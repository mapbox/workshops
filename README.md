## Workshops at Mapbox

We run many workshops - basic mapping on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio), satellite, spatial analysis in QGIS and web mapping using [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-mapbox-js/) and [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/) are recurring topics. This repository will serve as a resource for everyone who is interested or was a part of the workshop. It will share all the resources and materials that were used during the workshop. You can visit our [help](https://www.mapbox.com/help/) page to get more information for a particular topic, sample code or tutorials.
